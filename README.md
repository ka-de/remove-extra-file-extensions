# `remove-extra-file-extensions`

This Rust code is a script that renames text files in a directory. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what it does:

1. It first collects the command-line arguments into a vector of strings. If there is more than one argument, it uses the second argument as the directory to process. Otherwise, it defaults to `"E:/training_dir_staging"`.

2. It then uses the `WalkDir` crate to recursively walk through the directory and its subdirectories.

3. For each file in the directory, it checks if the file extension is `.txt`. If it is, it gets the full path of the file as a string.

4. It then checks if the filename contains an extra image extension (`.jpeg`, `.png`, or `.jpg`). If it does, it removes the image extension from the filename.

5. Finally, it renames the file with the new name and prints a message indicating that the file was renamed.

In summary, this script is useful for cleaning up text files that have been incorrectly named with an extra image extension. It's a handy tool for maintaining a clean and organized file system. Please note that this script will panic and stop if it encounters any errors, such as not having permission to rename a file. You might want to add error handling to make it more robust.
